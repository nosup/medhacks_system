        Thank you for applying for a travel reimbursement. Unfortunately, due to limited funds, we are unable to offer you a reimbursement at this time.
        <br/>
        If you will still be attending MedHacks without a reimbursement, please confirm your attendance <a href="{% url 'accounts:confirm' %}">here.</a>,
        and if not, please also confirm that you will not be able to make it and we hope to see you next year!
    </p>
